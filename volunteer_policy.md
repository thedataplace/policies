# The Data Place Volunteer Policy 
## Introduction
Volunteering is the commitment of time and energy for the benefit of society and the community: 
the environment of individuals outside one’s immediate family. It is undertaken freely and by 
choice without concern for financial gain.  

The Data Place believes in the value of voluntary activity as an important expression of 
citizenship and an essential component of a free and democratic society.  It supports and 
promotes volunteering in public and third sector organisations. The Data Place takes responsibility 
for ensuring that volunteers within its own organisation are appropriately involved, valued for their 
contribution and respected as colleagues.  

In adopting this volunteer policy The Data Place wishes to:  
* Formally acknowledge and support the role of volunteers in its work.
* Set out the principles governing the involvement of volunteers and provide a set of guidelines
* to ensure good practice in working with volunteers.
* Encourage and enable, rather than restrict, the involvement of volunteers.

This volunteer policy and accompanying guidelines are intended for use by The Data Place paid staff and volunteers.

## Volunteer Policy Statement
### The Data Place Equal Opportunities  
As an employer and engager of volunteers The Data Place is committed to a policy of equal opportunities. 
This principle will apply to service delivery, recruitment, promotion, training, facilities, procedures and 
all terms and conditions. Volunteers will be expected to adhere to our Equal Opportunities Policy, a copy of 
which can be found in the Volunteer Handbook.  

### Recruitment & Selection  
Recruitment of volunteers will be from all sections of the community and will be in line with our 
Equal Opportunities Policy. Appropriate targeting may be used to ensure we provide opportunities 
to marginalised or disadvantaged groups.  

### Information & Training
Volunteers will receive full information about their chosen area of work and will be given a clear idea 
of their responsibilities to The Data Place.  
Volunteers will be given induction and training in the specific tasks to be undertaken.  
Volunteers will be consulted in decisions which affect them.  

### Support & Supervision
Volunteers will be assigned a named contact person for supervision and support.  

### Problem-Solving
The Data Place recognises that problems do arise, and we aim to identify and resolve these problems 
at the earliest stage. Volunteers who have a problem of any kind should discuss it in the first 
instance with their named contact person.  

### Confidentiality  
Volunteers will be bound by the same confidentiality conditions as The Data Place paid staff.

### Expenses
The Data Place will ensure that there is a clear and accessible system to enable volunteers 
to claim out of pocket expenses.  

### Insurance
Volunteers will be adequately covered by insurance while carrying out agreed duties.

### Health and Safety
All volunteers are covered by the same health and safety policies and provisions as staff.

### Relations with Paid Staff
The Data Place is committed to ensuring that volunteers work complements the work of paid staff, and 
that it will not be used as a substitute for paid work.  
Steps will be taken to ensure that staff at all levels are clear about the roles of volunteers and 
to foster good working relationships between staff and volunteers.  
The Data Place recognises the need for training for all those working alongside and managing volunteers.

### Costs
The Data Place will endeavour to identify and cover the costs of involving volunteers and recognises 
the value of designated responsibilities within specific posts for the management of volunteers.

### References
On the basis of their voluntary work, volunteers will have the right to request a reference.

### Monitoring & Evaluation
The Data Place will systemically monitor and evaluate its involvement of volunteers with reference to this Volunteer Policy.

#### Review
This policy comes into force on 1st June 2023 and The Data Place commits itself to review the policy as and 
when changes in legislation or other factors make this necessary. The policy will be subject to a 
comprehensive review two years after its introduction. 

##### Review date: due 1st June 2025  

## Guidelines for Involving Volunteers  
These guidelines are intended for use along with the policy statement. 
They give further detail on recommended good practice in the involvement of 
volunteers within The Data Place.  

### Preparation
Prior to recruiting volunteers, full consultation and discussion should take place with users 
of the service, paid staff and unions to satisfy that there is a genuine need for volunteers and 
to develop a clear description of their role. A contact person within the section proposing to 
involve volunteers should be identified and the staff time and expenses to train, support 
and reimburse volunteers determined.  

### Recruitment
The Data Place has an Equal Opportunities Policy and will prevent discrimination particularly 
on the grounds of gender, gender presentation, marital status, disability, race, colour, religious belief, 
political belief, sexuality, nationality, ethnic origin, age, trade union activity, responsibility for 
dependents or employment status. (See statement and policy for details).  

In order to reach a wide section of the community, recruitment should be by a variety of means. 
Positive action in recruitment may be used for specific voluntary tasks.  For example, 
specific work with minority ethnic groups.  

### Initial Contact
People interested in becoming volunteers with The Data Place should be invited for an 
informal talk with the appropriate contact person.  They should:  

* Be given written information to take away.
* Have their role explained and how it fits in with The Data Place’s overall aims and ethos.
* Have the next stages of becoming a volunteer with The Data Place outlined.

If the volunteer wishes to proceed with the application at this stage, the contact person should 
fill out the application form for the volunteer (getting referees’ details) and ask the volunteer to sign. 
If the volunteer is undecided, agree the next step e.g., for the contact person to phone the potential 
volunteer in a week’s time.  

### Selection
All volunteers should complete an application form. Two written references will be required. 
If the volunteer is to carry out specialised work (e.g., IT support) at least one reference 
should relate directly to this. If volunteers may be working with vulnerable people, or in positions of trust, they should be asked 
to provide information on their application form about any criminal convictions that they may have.   

All information should be dealt with in the strictest confidence and should not necessarily 
prejudice the person being accepted for voluntary work.  

### Records
Minimum details should be kept on volunteers. This will include the application form, 
references, placement details, relevant information regarding the person’s health, correspondence and 
any other relevant information such as emergency contact details. Record keeping must be secure but 
accessible to other members of staff if you are absent. Data Protection legislation (currently GDPR) 
enables people to access information held about them via a Subject Access Request.

### Induction
Induction sessions should be provided for all new volunteers and should cover:   

* Role of volunteers.
* Responsibilities of volunteers.
* Arrangements for training, support and supervision.
* Contact person.
* Need for confidentiality.
* Ethos, mission and values.
* System for payment of expenses.
* Problem-solving procedures.
* Background to The Data Place.
* Building orientation.
* Health and Safety.
* Meeting staff.

During induction, volunteers should receive the Employee Handbook.  

## Expectations of Volunteers
The Data Place should expect volunteers to:  

* Participate in induction sessions.  
* Comply with existing policies and procedures.  
* Undertake voluntary work at agreed times.  
* Inform relevant staff if unable to attend.  
* Give some notice if unable to continue volunteering.  
* Raise any issues of concern relating to their voluntary work with the contact person.  
* Agree with the aims and ethos of the organisation.

### Placement
Once a suitable voluntary placement has been identified, details about the frequency and 
length of commitment and nature of the voluntary activity should be determined and an 
established trial period agreed. The Data Place reserves the right to ask volunteers to 
leave and will give reasons in writing if requested.

### Support, Supervision and Problem-Solving
Regular support/supervision should be available to each volunteer.  The type and level 
of support will depend on the needs of the volunteer and the nature of their role. 
Full information on this will be provided during induction. Each volunteer should have a 
clearly identified supervisor who is responsible for the day-to-day 
management and guidance of the volunteer and who will be able to offer advice, support and 
feedback on a regular basis.  

If a complaint about a volunteer arises, refer to the grievance policy.  

### Expenses
The procedures for claiming expenses should be clear and accessible. All agreed out of pocket 
expenses should be reimbursed on production of receipts. The pro forma should be used and the 
supervisor should liaise with admin staff.  

### Insurance  
It should be ensured that volunteers have appropriate insurance cover in terms of employers and public liability.
