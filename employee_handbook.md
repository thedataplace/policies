# The Data Place Employee Handbook  
## Introduction  
The Employee Handbook is designed to provide you with information about The Data Place and details of your employment. The Employee Handbook also contains the policies, procedures and rules which the organisation has adopted and you are expected to follow as a member of the team.  
Some of the policies, procedures and rules included in the Employee Handbook are referred to in your contract of employment. Some form part of your contract of employment with The Data Place and some do not. The Employee Handbook specifies which policies, procedures and rules are incorporated into your contract of employment. It is important to read the Employee Handbook carefully. If you have any questions about its contents, please raise them with your line manager.  
This Employee Handbook will be updated as and when changes occur.  

## Fair Working Commitment
As a social enterprise, The Data Place is serious about helping end inequality of access to technology and data as a prerequisite for a fairer society in other ways. To this end we take a positive approach to issues such as:
- remuneration (paying staff at least a Living Wage and not discriminating against any specific group in this respect)
- improving the wider diversity of our staff by being positive about employing those under-represented in the technology industry, such as older people, women, those from BAME backgrounds, those with disabilities, including mental health, and LGBT candidates
- providing ongoing development for staff in both training and development opportunities
- allowing Trade Union representation, even for staff employed as contractors, and having processes in place to ensure that staff have independent authorities to appeal to in case of any problems
Additionally, we apply the above principles to our suppliers and customers and will not engage with those which flout those principles; our company reputation is worth more than contracts that involve the exploitation of workers.  

## Equal Opportunities 
The Data Place is committed to encouraging diversity and eliminating discrimination in both its role as an employer and as a provider of services. Our aim is that our board, staff and contractors are truly representative of all sections of society and work in an environment where everyone is respected and able to perform to the best of their ability. Our policy is to provide equality and fairness for all in our employment and in our provision of services and not to discriminate on the grounds of gender, marital status, race, ethnic origin, colour, nationality, national origin, disability, sexual orientation, religion or age.  
The Data Place opposes all forms of unlawful and unfair discrimination. It is our policy to provide a suitable environment for people with disabilities. All reasonable facilities will be provided for staff and contractors with disabilities to perform their roles without difficulty or disadvantage.  
The Company will not tolerate direct or indirect discrimination against any person on grounds of age, disability, gender / gender reassignment, marriage / civil partnership, pregnancy / maternity, race, religion or belief, sex, or sexual orientation whether in the field of recruitment, terms and conditions of employment, career progression, training, transfer or dismissal.  
It is also the responsibility of all staff in their daily actions, decisions and behaviour to endeavour to promote these concepts, to comply with all relevant legislation and to ensure that they do not discriminate against colleagues, customers, suppliers or any other person associated with the Company.  

In adopting these principles, The Data Place:
1.	Will not tolerate acts that breach this policy and all such breaches or alleged breaches will be taken seriously, be fully investigated and may be subject to disciplinary action where appropriate.
2.	Fully recognises its legal obligations under all relevant legislation and codes of practice.	
3.	Will allow staff to pursue any matter through the internal procedures which they believe has exposed them to inequitable treatment within the scope of this policy. If you need to access these procedures they can be obtained from your line manager e.g. Grievance Procedure, etc.
4.	Will ensure that all managers understand and maintain their responsibilities and those of their team under this policy.
5.	Will offer opportunities for flexible working patterns, wherever operationally feasible, to help employees to combine a career with their domestic responsibilities.
6.	Will provide equal opportunity to all who apply for vacancies through open competition.
7.	Will select candidates only on the basis of their ability to carry out the job, using a clear and open process.
8.	Will provide all employees with the training and development that they need to carry out their job effectively.
9.	Will provide all reasonable assistance to employees who are or who become disabled, making reasonable adjustments wherever possible to provide continued employment. We will ensure an appropriate risk assessment is carried out and that appropriate specialist advice is obtained when necessary.
10.	Will distribute and publicise this policy statement throughout the Company.  

## Dignity at Work
The Company believes that the working environment should at all times be supportive of the dignity and respect of individuals. If a complaint of harassment is brought to the attention of management, it will be investigated promptly and appropriate action will be taken.  

### What and How of Harassment
Sexual harassment is defined as “unwanted conduct of a sexual nature, or other conduct based on sex, affecting the dignity of women and men at work”.  This can include unwelcome physical, verbal or non-verbal conduct.  
Harassment can be defined as conduct, which is unwanted and offensive and affects the dignity of an individual or group of individuals. People can be subject to harassment on a wide variety of grounds including:  
- race, ethnic origin, nationality or skin colour
- sex or sexual orientation
- religious or political convictions
- willingness to challenge harassment, leading to victimisation 
- disabilities, sensory impairments or learning difficulties
- status as ex-offenders
- age
- real or suspected infection with a blood borne virus (eg AIDS/HIV) 
- membership of a trade union or activities associated with membership.  

Forms may include:
- physical contact ranging from touching to serious assault
- verbal and written harassment through jokes, offensive language, gossip and slander, sectarian songs, letters and so on
- visual display of posters, graffiti, obscene gestures, flags and emblems
- isolation or non-cooperation at work, exclusion from social activities
- coercion ranging from pressure for sexual favours to pressure to participate in political/religious groups
- intrusion by pestering, spying, following someone
- bullying
- real or suspected infection with a blood borne virus (eg AIDS/HIV) 
- membership of a trade union or activities associated with membership.  

If you feel you are being harassed you are strongly encouraged to seek early advice/support from your line manager. If your feel your line manager is harassing you, then you should contact his/her immediate line manager.  
You should also keep a written record detailing the incidents of harassment and any requests made to the harasser to stop.  This written record should be made as soon as possible after the events giving rise to concern and should include dates, times, places and the circumstances of what happened.  
The Data Place has a formal procedure for dealing with these issues which you can obtain from your line manager or any senior member of staff.  

## Performance and Behaviour at Work
### Data Protection and Confidentiality
You must be aware of and comply with all elements of the Data Protection Act 1998. No employee should disclose any confidential information either while employed or after having left the organisation, unless specifically given permission to do so. Any breach of confidentiality will be dealt with under the disciplinary procedures and may lead to dismissal.  

### Consumption of alcohol and drug abuse
The organisation forbids the consumption of alcohol and use or storage of drugs in the workplace, nor will it permit any employee to work whilst under the influence of alcohol or drugs. Any such instances will be dealt with under the disciplinary procedure and may lead to your summary dismissal.  

### Professional conduct and public statements
All employees have a responsibility to act in good faith and to promote the good name and effectiveness of their employer. You are expected to be trustworthy and to conduct yourself reasonably at all times. No employee is permitted to give press or other media interviews or assist with or be involved in the publication of any article relating to the business affairs of the organisation or in relation to the organisation’s intellectual property, without prior consent from a member of senior management.  

### Conflict of Interest
You should not, directly or indirectly, engage in, or have any interest, financial or otherwise, in any other business enterprise which interferes or is likely to interfere with your independent exercise of judgement in THe Data Place’s best interest.  
Generally a conflict of interests exists when an employee is involved in an activity:
- which provides products or services directly to, or purchase products or services from The Data Place
- which subjects the employee to unreasonable time demands that prevent the employee from devoting proper attention to his or her responsibilities to The Data Place
- which is so operated that the employee’s involvement with the outside business activity will reflect adversely on The Data Place.  
Should you be in doubt as to whether an activity involves a conflict, you should discuss the situation with your manager.  

### Bribery and other Corrupt Behaviour 
The Company has a strict anti-bribery and corruption policy in line with the Bribery Act (2010). A bribe is defined as: giving someone a financial or other advantage to encourage that person to perform their functions or activities improperly or to reward that person for having already done so. 
If you bribe (or attempt to bribe) another person, intending either to obtain or retain business for the company, or to obtain or retain an advantage in the conduct of the company's business this will be considered gross misconduct. Similarly accepting or allowing another person to accept a bribe will be considered gross misconduct. In these circumstances you will be subject to formal investigation under the Company’s disciplinary procedures, and disciplinary action up to and including dismissal may be applied.  

### Expenses Policy
The Data Place recognises that no member of staff, paid or unpaid, should be placed at financial disadvantage as a result of their work for the organisation. Equally there should be no financial gain.  
The Expenses Policy provides guidance on the types of expenses which can be claimed and at what rates. The Policy also ensures that all claims are treated consistently and appropriately.  

## Joining The Data Place
### Probationary period
On joining The Data Place you will serve a 1 month probationary period. During this time you will be thinking about whether you wish to remain working with us. Your line manager, at the same time, will be assessing your suitability for your role.  
If you do not reach the standards required by The Data Place, your employment may be terminated at any time during the probationary period with one week’s notice. The Data Place reserves the right to extend the probationary period where required. The ACAS Code on Discipline, Dismissal and Grievance Procedures do not apply during the probationary period.  

### Induction
We are keen that you have every assistance to help you settle into your role quickly. Your induction programme sets out what to expect on your first day and the induction process we will follow. You will meet your colleagues and you will receive information on The Data Place, your terms and conditions of employment, policies and procedures, health and safety.  
If there is anything you need to know about The Data Place or what is required of you in your role, please ask your line manager.  

### Changes to personal details
To help us to assist you, especially in cases of emergency, it is essential that all information on your personnel records is complete, correct and up to date. Please inform your line manager as soon as there are any changes to your personal details. Your personal information is confidential and will not be released to outside sources without your prior authorisation.  

### Criminal Records Checks
Certain employees of The Data Place may be required to undergo a criminal records office check. This is only in very special circumstances where your employment with us means you are likely to come into contact with children or vulnerable adults (or certain other particular circumstances). Should this be the case, we will discuss the situation with you prior to confirming your appointment (or relevant change to your job).  

## How we work
### Communications
Your prime source of information about your role or the organisation is your line manager. It is part of his or her job to inform, answer questions and listen to constructive opinions, comments or suggestions. In addition, we have regular staff meeting and team meetings.  

### Task and project management
Projects are logged, managed and monitored using Asana. When you join The Data Place you will be added to the Asana organisation and any set tasks will be allocated to you there after being discussed and assigned with your line manager. We ask all staff and contractors to log in to Asana and check for tasks and queries each work day, and we expect everyone to deal promptly with items in their inbox or on their task list.  

## Pay
### Contractor payments
We ask contractors to log their hours in Asana, and to invoice us at the end of each month worked according to the number of hours logged. We aim to pay invoices promptly, ideally within 7 days and no later than 30 days after the date of the invoice. If you have an issue with an unpaid invoice issued to The Data Place, raise the issue with your line manager in the first instance and they will investigate.  

### Payment of salaries
Salaries are paid on the last working day of each calendar month by cheque/BACS transfer. An individual payslip showing gross pay, fixed and variable deductions and net pay will be given to you each month. Your starting salary is that stated in your contract of employment. We will let you know of any subsequent changes to your salary which is normally reviewed annually.  

### Deductions from salaries
The Data Place will make any deductions from your pay as required by law or as authorised by you in writing. In addition The Data Place reserves the right to make salary adjustments to your pay where an overpayment has been made or in cases of malicious damage which result in dismissal.  

## Hours of work
Your normal hours are those set out in your contract of employment. Full time employees in The Data Place are contracted to work 37 hours per week. If you are part time and also have a second job, you should be aware of the rules of the Working Time Regulations 1998.  
Paid breaks are included in the standard working day, to a total of 1 hour per full work day. The timing of breaks is left to the discretion of the employee, although in exceptional circumstances your line manager may require you to take breaks at specific times to ensure coverage of essential duties.  

### TOIL
Where employees are authorised to work on behalf of The Data Place in addition to contractual hours, time off in lieu (TOIL) will be allowed. All work carried on outside of normal contractual hours must be authorised in advance. Where TOIL is accrued, compensating time off should be taken as soon as possible in order to avoid build up.  
TOIL accrued in the evening will be accrued at single time and TOIL accrued at weekends/ Public Holidays will be accrued at time and a half.  

##Contractor provisions
###Contracts and payment
There’s a standard contract available and we will agree invoicing and payment schedules at the beginning of the contract. We’ll pay you within 7 days of your invoice and we won’t hire you unless we have the money to pay you.

###Hours
Contractors are paid for the hours they do, and if they do more because we’ve asked them to, we’ll compensate them. Having said that, we’ll never commit you to doing more than 40 hours a week and if there’s a crunch on, you get TOIL afterwards.

###Health needs
We’ll always make reasonable adjustments for contractors with health issues and we don’t just hire “healthy” people - your health is your business, not ours. This includes mental health issues as well as physical ones, and we’ll always give you the space you need to work sustainably with us.

###Life Goals
We can’t guarantee that working with us will help you achieve your work and life goals (wait, what?) but we’ll communicate with you like an adult at all times and if your aims don’t intersect with ours, let’s not work together.

###Insurance
Contractors need to make sure they have their own insurance, but TDP has public liability insurance that covers them whilst they carry out work for us. We encourage them to cover themselves against other risks, particularly around health, belongings and unemployment.

###Tools
Since we’re mainly a digital business, a laptop and a phone are the tools of choice. So far no-one’s showed up without these things but we will provide any kit that people need to get their jobs done.

###Social contact
We are based in a co-working space, which we find helps us to stay centred. I personally hate working in a space on my own and will often relocate from my home office to somewhere with a bit of stuff going on. However, not everyone sees it this way and we will accommodate different working styles and encourage staff to mix it up a bit.

###Timings and venues
Linked to the above, we expect work to be carried out in its most impactful time and place. Sometimes a meeting is best handled face to face, but not if it’s a 5 minute catch up with someone who is hundreds of miles away. Staff are expected to make decisions on these things based on business value, and to consult supervisory staff or directors if they are unsure. Similarly we want to provide an office environment that supports productivity and is comfortable: we want to know if there’s anything we can do in terms of providing furniture, space, coffee, doughnuts etc.

###Credit
Although the IP created during your time with TDP belongs to us, that doesn’t mean you won’t be credited. Good work will always generate formal accreditation, praise and good references to enable you to build on it for future work. We are similarly always happy for you to talk about the work you have done, we try and run the organisation as openly as possible.

###Alignment
We’ll always be clear about
- How much time, and when, we expect you to work with us
- Our approach to doing business as a social enterprise
- The scale, sources and sustainability of our funding
We aim to be as transparent about our organisation as possible. We’ll also be clear about our personal beliefs but that won’t mean we’ll discriminate against you if you have different ones. There’s a process if you feel discriminated against with a range of options for you to use to pursue remediation.

###Travel
We try to minimise business travel wherever possible and locate our team close to our base in Plymouth. One of the conditions of our initial funding was to support Plymouth-based staff and organisations as much as possible and so that is what we do.

###Learning
What will you learn while working with us? Well, that’s mainly up to you but we definitely hope you’ll find out some things about Open Data.

###Payment upfront?
As a matter of policy, contractors should never have to pay for anything upfront as a result of working with us. If you need something, we expect that we would talk at the beginning of your contract and we’ll arrange to get it for you. We won’t be able to pay you up front, however - but if you do arrive at us in a distressed state as a result of someone else not paying you then we can arrange to pay your invoices much more quickly.


### Leave
You are entitled to 20 days/weeks holiday per year for a full time working week. Part time employees will have their holiday entitlement proportionate to their normal hours of work as stated in the Contract of Employment. This will include a pro rata entitlement to Public Holidays. If you join The Data Place part way through a holiday year you are entitled to the appropriate portion of leave based on the number of completed months of service.  

### Holiday Year
The holiday period runs between the 1st April and the 31st March. Unused leave days may be carried over to the following year, up to a maximum of 4 days.  

### Public and bank holidays
You are granted all public holidays with pay. If you are part time you will receive a pro-rata entitlement (one fifth of your working week per Public/Bank Holiday. Where time off on a Public Holiday exceeds entitlement, the time must be made up using Holiday entitlement, TOIL or by rearranging working hours that week. Public Holiday entitlement for part time employees will be included on the Annual Leave Form.  

The days of public and bank holidays in England and Wales are:  
- New Year's Day
- Good Friday
- Easter Monday
- May Day
- Spring Bank Holiday
- Late Summer Bank Holiday
- Christmas Day
- Boxing Day  

### Holiday booking
To request a holiday, speak to your line manager.  Please give as much notice as possible when you are booking time off. In the event that a holiday request has to be refused, the line manager will give at least as much notice of refusal as the amount of leave requested. Holidays are granted on a 'first come first served' basis so the more notice you give the more likely it will be that you will be able to take your holiday when you wish.  
On termination of employment all outstanding annual leave must have been taken prior to the effective date of departure. At the discretion of the Director, payment may be made in lieu of holiday entitlement. Such payments shall meet the requirements of Regulation 14 of the Working Time Regulations 1998.  
Should you leave within a leave year and holiday has been taken in excess of any entitlement accrued up to the date of departure, then a financial adjustment will be made to your final salary based on the proportion of the year worked.  

### Sickness Absence
The Data Place is committed to maintaining the health, well-being and attendance of all our employees. We value the contribution our employees make to our success and we miss that contribution when any employee is unable to work.  
Our absence policy is based on the following principles:
 - we undertake to provide reasonable payments to employees who are unable to work due to sickness
 - we will support employees who have genuine grounds for absence for whatever reason.  This support includes ‘special leave’ for necessary absences not caused by sickness, a flexible approach to the taking of annual leave and returning to work after long term sickness
 - we will use an occupational health adviser to help identify the nature of an employee’s illness and advise the employee and the line manager on the best way to improve the employee’s health and well-being
 - we will respect the confidentiality of all information relating to an employee’s sickness and information will be held in line with all data protection legislation  
Regular, punctual attendance is an implied term of every employee’s contract of employment and we ask each employee to take responsibility for maintaining good attendance and reporting absence according to the procedures set out in this Handbook.  
The disciplinary procedures will be used if an explanation for absence is not forthcoming or is not thought to be satisfactory.  However The Data Place does not wish to create a culture of 'presentee-ism' and where an employee or contractor is sick with a communicable diseases such as a cold, flu, sickness bug etc or has an illness or injury making travel difficult, but nevertheless feels able to complete some work-related tasks, working from home is actively encouraged where the employee wishes to do so.  

### Absence reporting
You must report your absence from work owing to illness to your line manager as early as possible, and no later than the normal start of work, on the first day of sickness. When possible notification of absence should be given the previous evening to allow staff cover to be arranged.  
In the event that your line manager is unavailable, you should leave a message with (insert name) who will record the absence. When reporting your absence you should give a clear indication of the nature of your illness and the likely date of your return to work.
### Certification
A self-certification may be made for the first 7 calendar days of absence. From the 8th day onwards a Fit for work note is required. A final Fit for work note giving the date on which you will be fit to resume work must be given to your line manager prior to your return to work. If your absence is not continuously covered by a self-certificate, Fit for work note or in‑patient certificate, it may be treated as an unauthorised absence and dealt with using the Disciplinary Policy.  

### Sick Pay
#### Statutory sick pay
In accordance with the eligibility requirements of the Inland Revenue, you may be entitled to Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) when you are absent from work due to sickness. The main features of the scheme are:
 - the first three days of incapacity are unpaid (called ‘waiting days’)
 - SSP is paid for up to 28 weeks
 - once SSP is exhausted, an employee normally transfers onto benefits paid directly by the Department for Work and Pensions
 - If two periods of sickness are separated by less than eight weeks (56 days) then they are linked and the employee need not serve the waiting days again  
Information on statutory sick pay can be obtained from the Inland Revenue.  

#### Company Sick Pay
Where company sick pay is payable, the amount paid under Statutory Sick Pay will be deducted from employee’s pay.  

## Time off
### Special Leave Arrangements
Sympathetic consideration will be given to any hardship, difficulty or special circumstances which might necessitate a request for absence from work on compassionate grounds.  Such circumstances might include bereavement or severe illness of a close relative or dependant.  
Whilst you are expected to use your annual leave as far as possible for attending to personal affairs, special leave in excess of any statutory entitlement may be allowed in exceptional circumstances at the discretion of the line manager. Each request will be considered on its merits but as much advance notice as possible must be given.    
Requests for unpaid leave will not normally be allowed except where they relate to the special circumstances described above.  

### Antenatal care
All pregnant employees are entitled to time off with pay to keep appointments for antenatal care. Antenatal care may include relaxation classes and parent-craft classes made on the advice of a registered medical practitioner, midwife or health visitor.  
Except for the first appointment, you must show your line manager, if requested, a certificate from a registered medical practitioner, midwife or health visitor, confirming the pregnancy together with an appointment card or some other document showing that an appointment has been made.  

### Maternity, Paternity and Adoption
All qualifying employees are entitled to statutory maternity, statutory paternity, and statutory adoption leave and pay. A qualifying employee must request and take leave according to the statutory procedure. For further information about statutory entitlements and current rates visit https://www.gov.uk/maternity-pay-leave.  

### Time off to deal with a family emergency
All employees are entitled to a reasonable time off work without pay, to deal with an emergency involving a dependant. For example, if a dependant falls ill or is injured, if care arrangements break down, or to arrange or attend a dependant's funeral.  

### Parental leave
Employees who have completed one year's service are entitled to 13 weeks’ unpaid parental leave for each child born or adopted. The leave can start once the child is born or placed for adoption with the employee or as soon as the employee has completed a year's service, whichever is later. It may be taken at any time up to the child's fifth birthday (or until five years after placement in the case of adoption). Parents of disabled children can take 18 weeks up to the child's 18th birthday.  
- Parental leave may be taken in blocks of a week, unless it is taken to care for a disabled child, when it can be taken in days. The employee can take no more than 4 weeks parental leave in any year. Part of a week counts as a full week in calculating parental leave taken for that year. For example, if a full time employee takes 3 days parental leave and then returns to work, one week is deducted from the 13 week entitlement.
- An employee requesting parental leave is required to give a minimum of 21 days’ notice, specifying start and end dates.
- The Data Place will agree to the request unless it would be detrimental to the organisation to do so, in which case the organisation will seek to postpone the parental leave. A decision to postpone parental leave will be notified to the employee not more than 7 days after the Employee’s notice was given.
- The Data Place will not seek to postpone parental leave when it has been requested to coincide with the birth or adoption of a child.
- Parental Leave will not be postponed for any more than 6 months from the date on which the employee requested it to start.  

### Flexible working
Parents of children under the age of six or disabled children under the age of eighteen have a specific right to apply to The Data Place to work more flexibly. The request can cover hours of work, times of work and place of work and may include requests for different patterns of work. Carers of adults also have the right to apply for flexible working. All staff and contractors at The Data Place may request flexible working patterns as long as agreed hours and tasks can be completed within the requested working pattern.  

### Time Off for Public Duties
Employees who hold certain public positions will be allowed reasonable time off with pay to perform duties associated with that position. The amount of time off allowed will be at the discretion of the line manager and will take account of time off already received and the effect of the absence on the satisfactory running of the organisation.  

#### Trade Union Membership and Duties
All employees shall be free to join an appropriate trade union. Reasonable time off with pay will be allowed to recognised trade union representatives to enable you to undertake duties concerned with industrial relations within the organisation.  

## Supervision and Appraisal
All employees are part of a staff supervision and appraisal process. These are positive exercises designed to encourage and assist staff in their professional and personal development.
It is our policy that employees should have regular supervision with their line manager and an annual appraisal. It is the responsibility of the line manager to arrange these meetings and send the appropriate preparation information to the employee in advance. A record of the supervision or appraisal will be kept on individual personnel files. These files will be kept for one year following the resignation of the employee after which only summary information will be retained to provide references for potential employers if requested by the employee.  

### Training, development and promotion
The Data Place places the highest value on training and development for its staff. We are committed to invest in the training of our staff in order to achieve our business objectives.
Initial and longer term training needs will be agreed with your line manager to enable you to perform your job as effectively as possible. This process will continue as part of your regular performance reviews.  

## Disciplinary Procedure
The Data Place wishes to ensure high standards from its employees. The Disciplinary Procedure enables the organisation to take appropriate action against you where your performance or conduct is unsatisfactory.  
In order to ensure that you are treated fairly and consistently The Data Place will adopt the following procedure.  

### Written Warning
A written warning may be given immediately if it is felt that the matter is serious, if there has been no improvement in standards following a verbal warning or if a further incident of a similar kind occurs. Your line manager or Director will invite you to a hearing to discuss the problem and may give you a written warning.  

### Final Written Warning
A final written warning may be given if an initial offence is very serious or if conduct, performance or attendance remains unsatisfactory following a verbal or written warning. It may also be given if an incident of unsatisfactory performance or conduct occurs following a previous verbal or written warning. Your line manager or Director will invite you to a hearing to discuss the problem and may give you a final written warning. The final written warning will state that any recurrence of the offence, or further misconduct of a similar nature within 12 months will result in dismissal. Final written warnings will be kept on your personnel file.  

### Dismissal
If, following a final written warning, your performance, conduct or attendance does not improve significantly or further misconduct occurs, you may be dismissed. Dismissal will be authorised by (insert name). Your line manager or Director will invite you to a hearing to discuss the problem, informing you that the disciplinary meeting may lead to your dismissal. Should the meeting result in dismissal, you will be given an amount of notice equivalent to that specified in your Contract of Employment or pay in lieu of such notice. You will have the right to appeal against the decision but where the notice period would expire before the outcome of the appeal is known, you will be suspended without pay until the appeal process is completed. You will receive a written statement of your dismissal within 14 days of the dismissal hearing.  
At all stages of the disciplinary procedure you will have the right to be accompanied by a Trade Union Representative or a work colleague. You will also be given the right to appeal against all disciplinary warnings.  

### Gross Misconduct
Gross misconduct includes any action which threatens The Data Place, its work or its reputation, the people or organisations connected with The Data Place or members of the public or which destroys our trust in you. Examples include theft, damage to property, fraud, incapacity to work through being under the influence of alcohol or illegal drugs or other substance abuse, physical assault or threatening behaviour, gross insubordination, negligence, harassment or any other discriminatory behaviour or conduct which endangers others. It would also cover breaches of confidentiality or professional conduct and inappropriate or misuse of office equipment, including computer, e-mail or internet access.  
This list is not exhaustive and actions not listed above may also constitute gross misconduct. If you are accused of an act of gross misconduct you will be suspended on full pay for up to 10 working days whilst an investigation takes place. If, after investigation, it is decided that you have found to be negligent or have committed an act or acts of gross misconduct, you will be dismissed without notice and without pay in lieu of notice.  

### Suspension
If a senior manager, having reviewed the evidence, considers that the matter may result in your dismissal, with or without notice, or that your presence may result in a witness in any disciplinary proceedings feeling intimidated, you may be suspended on full pay. The fact of such suspension will not be taken into account in any disciplinary proceedings.  

### Appeals
You are entitled to appeal against any disciplinary warning or decision to dismiss. To do so you must notify your line manager or, in his/her absence, any senior member of staff, in writing within five working days of receiving the written warning or other written notification of any decision. Your letter must specify the issues you wish to appeal against or contest.  

### Grievance procedure
The Data Place’s aim is always to encourage employees to have an open and honest relationship with their line manager and colleagues and to raise any concerns about any aspect of their employment in an appropriate manner. This procedure should be used to settle all disputes or grievances which you may wish to raise concerning other employees or volunteers, your work, the organisation or other matters relating to your employment or volunteering. The purpose is to settle any grievance fairly, simply and quickly.  

#### Stage 1
If you have a grievance about a matter concerned with your employment you should set out your grievance in writing and send the statement or a copy of it to your line manager.  

#### Stage 2
Your manager will invite you to a hearing to discuss the grievance. You have the right to be accompanied at this hearing by a colleague or by a trade union official.  
After the hearing your manager will inform you of The Data Place’s response to your grievance.  

#### Stage 3
If you wish to appeal against the response to your grievance you should contact your line manager. You have the right to be accompanied at this hearing by a colleague or by a Trade Union Representative.  
Where reasonably practical, the appeal will be dealt with by a more senior manager than the one who attended the first hearing.  

## Whistleblowing
If you have any concerns about The Data Place, and its work, these should be raised with your line manager. If your line manager isn’t available or the issue raised concerns them, the issue should be raised with the next most senior staff member. All employees are protected by the Public Disclosure Act.  

## Health and safety
The Data Place has a legal duty to protect the health and safety of its employees and others. We take this responsibility seriously and have made health and safety a management priority. We expect our employees at all levels to take care to avoid injury to themselves and others and to co-operate with the implementation of the company’s health and safety arrangements.  

## Termination of employment
If you wish to resign you must give the required written notice to your line manager as stated in your contract of employment. If The Data Place decides to terminate your employment you will be notified in writing.  
Unless your written statement of your main terms and conditions of employment specifies longer periods of notice, the minimum periods of notice are:
- Length of continuous service -- Notice entitlement
- More than one month but less than two years -- One week
- More than two years -- one week per whole year of service, up to a maximum of 12 weeks  
The Data Place may give the equivalent pay in lieu of notice.  
On leaving The Data Place, you must return all items of the comapny’s property eg. mobile phone, laptop, documentation. Failure to do so may incur a deduction from your final salary payment.  
The Data Place may require an employee to take garden leave and the organisation has no obligation to provide work during this time, but all contractual benefits will continue to apply.  

## Retirement
In line with current legislation The Data Place does not have an age where it expects employees to retire. It is however our policy to have regular workplace/appraisal discussions with all our staff where they can discuss performance and any development needs they may have, as well as their future aims and aspirations. Staff and their managers can also use this opportunity to discuss retirement planning should the employee wish to do so.  
You should ensure that you inform your line manager at least 6 months before you plan to retire to ensure all appropriate arrangements are made (e.g. sourcing a replacement, mobilising your Company pension etc.).
